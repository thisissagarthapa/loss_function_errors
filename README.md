# Error Function and Loss Metrics

This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of common error functions and loss metrics:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Computes the average absolute differences between true and predicted values.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Calculates the average squared differences between true and predicted values.
- **Log Loss (Binary Cross-Entropy):** Evaluates the performance of classification models with probabilistic outputs.
- **Matrix Multiplication (Dot Product):** Performs matrix operations for advanced machine learning tasks.

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## **Applications**
- Evaluate regression models using MAE and MSE.
- Measure the performance of classification models using Log Loss.
- Perform matrix operations to support machine learning workflows.

## **Usage**
1. Clone the repository or copy the scripts.
2. Run the metrics in a Python environment.
3. Analyze outputs to understand model performance.
